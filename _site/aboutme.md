Hello World! Good to see you here! My name is Sahil Wadhwa, currently a master student at __UofI Urbana-Champaign__, majoring in __Statistics__. I hold a Bachelors in Technology degree in Computer Science. 

I have around 3 years of work experience in the industry where I mostly focussed on Machine Learning related problems in the domain of __Natural Language Processing (NLP)__ . I am interested in large scale machine learning problems that involves semantic understanding and recently I have gained interest in the application of Reinforcement Learning to finance problems in order to gain better insights of the financial market. 


TL;DR - I like doing things that I haven't done before and getting my hands dirty is one of my few hobbies :) In free time, I like solving puzzles (my personal favorite is Monty Hall) and cooking.
